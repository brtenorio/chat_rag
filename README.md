# Interactive Chatbot with PDF and URL Loader

## Overview
This project is an interactive chatbot built using LangChain with Streamlit that allows users to upload a PDF document or provide a URL to engage in multi-turn conversations. The chatbot can answer questions based on the content of the uploaded PDF or the content fetched from the provided URL, maintaining context throughout the conversation. You can chose between Anthropic's Sonet and Haiku models, along with the maximum number of tokens.

## Features
- **PDF Upload**: Users can upload a PDF file, and the chatbot will extract and utilize its content.
- **URL Input**: Users can provide a valid URL, and the chatbot will simulate fetching content from it.
- **Multi-Turn Conversations**: The chatbot retains context across multiple interactions, allowing for a natural conversational flow.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly experience.
